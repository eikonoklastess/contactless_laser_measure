## Overview
this tool/program aims to measure object cross-section precisely using a camera and line laser. Currently it is setup to measure most precisely circles radii using arcs but it can be used to estimate anything. This project is uncompleted. Please contact @eikono@proton.me

## Technical Details
(* use light mode to see the equations *)

To be able to find real 3D coordinates from an image we triangulate the points corresponding to the laser in the image for this we need to know the position of the camera and its intrinsic

![intrinsic](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?K=%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7Df_x%26s%26c_x%5C%5C0%26f_y%26c_y%5C%5C0%260%261%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D) 

and the equation of the plane corresponding to the laser line 

![plane](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Ax+By+Cz+D=0). 

These are obtained in the calibration portion of the software. with the Camera intrinsic we can undistort the camera image to obtain a perfect pinhole camera image

For each point I(x,y) you can convert them into normalized camera coordinate with that equation:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%20u%20%5C%5C%20v%20%5C%5C%201%20%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%20=%20%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%20%5Cfrac%7Bx%20-%20c_x%7D%7Bf_x%7D%20%5C%5C%20%5Cfrac%7By%20-%20c_y%7D%7Bf_y%7D%20%5C%5C%201%20%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D)

The resulting vector (u,v,1) is the direction vector of the ray in camera coordinate going from the pixel throught the camera centre to the real object. Here's the equation of the ray:

![ray equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathbf%7BP%7D(t)%20=%20t%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D%20u%20%5C%5C%20v%20%5C%5C%201%20%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D,%20%5Cquad%20t%20%5Cgeq%200)

Now to find the real 3D coordinate all we have to do is to substitute the ray equation into the plane equation:


![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A(ut)+B(vt)+C(t)+D=0)

Then solve for t:

![Equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t=-\frac{D}{Au+Bv+C})

Then pluging back t in the ray equation will give 3D coordinate in software we then do some projection to obtain a clean 2D plane of points but that only contribute to clean visuals of the cross-sections.

## Features/Usage
The program is separated in 3 parts: 
- image calibration: you need a checkered pattern with known dimension that you'll input in the software. then you need to capture 20 images of the pattern. this will compute the camera matrix and some distortion coefficients.
- plane coefficient calibration: because we are working with a janky setup and i cant bother to measure thing very precicely i wrote this tool that takes an estimate for the position of the plane and images of cylinders cross sections with know radii to find the exact coordinate of the plane. (this is janky and doesnt work properly once you finish the calibration you need to note the number and write them manually in the program)
- measuring: here you have on the left a live feed of the camera and with an overlay of the detected laser points (if they arent well detected put the setup in a controlled environment until the laser is most well detected) and on the left there is the whole laser plane in real coordinate. The software can measure anything that this plane intersect.

## Installing and Running the Project
### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contactless-laser-measure.git
   cd contactless-laser-measure
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application  
To start the program, run:  
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

### Setup
you need a line laser pointing down at ~90ยบ and a camera angle toward the intersection of the table and laser heres and example of my setup:
